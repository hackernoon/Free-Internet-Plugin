# The Free Internet Plugin

A free Internet is a better Internet. **This Chrome browser plugin removes paywalled content from Google search results.**

If you don’t want to pay for the story, the headline shouldn’t even be an option to click. The business model of paywalls - i.e. annoy the user with a bait and switch ad for content a hundred times, and then they convert and pay every month until they die - hinders the internet’s ability to be a free and open experience. Hacker Noon believes that if the user doesn’t want to run into a paywall, they should be able to filter paywalled content out of its search results and newsfeeds.
This plugin removes known paywalled sites from your Google results. 

You can install it [here!](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-free-internet-plugin/lodclhfimkjdjmmjgeioendfjpgoghoo)
